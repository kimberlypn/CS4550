# HW02 - HTML, CSS, and JS  

## Index 
The index page provides links to the three tasks that I had to complete.

## Task 1 
For the first task, I had to create a page with the name of an animal as a header, where each letter is a different color, include a picture of the animal, and create links to three different pages and a table of the first eight powers of two.

## Task 2 
For the second task, I had to create a page with a header starting at the number ten and three buttons. One button alerts the user of the current value, another button increments the number by one, and the last button appends a new paragraph containing the number to the bottom of the page.

## Task 3
For the third task, practice floats by creating a table. Each link in the left column toggles some text in the right column.
