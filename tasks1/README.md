# Tasks1
## Part 1
On the home page, there is a button to register an account. As of now, the user
only needs to input a name and a unique email. Once the account has successfully
been created, the user is redirected to the home page, where she can then log in
via her email. After logging in, the user is able to view all tasks that have
been created. The user can create a new task by clicking the 'New Task' link in
the bottom left of the table. By default, the task is assigned to the user, but
she can use the dropdown to assign the task to someone else. The minutes spent
must be in increments of 15. After filling in all of the fields and clicking
the 'Submit' button, the user is redirected to the tasks index page, where she
can choose to edit or view any tasks. Once done, the user can log out via the
link in the top right.
