# Task Tracker
## Part 1
On the home page, there is a button to register an account. As of now, the user
only needs to input a name and a unique email. The email needs to be unique
since it is used to log in, and the server will throw an error if the user tries
to register an email that is already in the database. It will also throw an
error if either field is left blank. Once the account has successfully been
created, the user is redirected to the home page, where she can then log in via
her email. The server will throw an error message if the email entered is not in
the database.

After logging in, the user is able to view all tasks that have been created. The
user can create a new task by clicking the 'New Task' link at the bottom left of
the table. By default, the task is assigned to the user, but she can use the
dropdown menu to choose a different user. The server will throw an error if any
of the fields are left blank. However, the 'completed' and 'time_spent' fields
have a default of false and 0, respectively. If the user wants to change the
minutes spent, it must be in increments of 15, which the server will validate
before saving to the database. After filling in all of the fields and clicking
the 'Submit' button, the user is redirected to the tasks index page, where she
can choose to edit or view any tasks. Once done, the user can log out via the
link in the top right.
